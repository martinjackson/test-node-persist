# How to get started
```
git clone https://github.com/martinjackson/test-node-persist.git
npm install
npm run test
```


## PREP before the early example worked
```
$ mkdir -p .node-persist/storage

```
was generating this error `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\Martinjackson\projects\
test-node-persist\.node-persist\storage\b068931cc450442b63f5b3d276ea4297' `
